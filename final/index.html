  <p>Acceptance rate into the University of Maryland dropped to its lowest rate in a decade during this year’s admission cycle, according to <a href="https://www.irpa.umd.edu/CampusCounts/" target="_blank">counts</a> by the school’s Office of Institutional Research, Planning and Assessment. The IRPA couldn’t be reached for comment.</p>

  <p>The admission rate dropped about 11 percentage points to 40.5 percent from the 2019-2020 cycle. The 2019-2020 cycle was the first one since the university started allowing Common Application submissions, previously they only accepted people through the Coalition Application. This likely explains the jump in the number of applicants jumped from 32,211 to 50,306.</p>

  <p>The university’s Director of Undergraduate Admissions Shannon Gundy told the Diamondback in November that <a href="https://dbknews.com/2021/11/17/admissions-students-campus-freshman/" target="_blank">her office found</a> “most schools experience about a 10 percent increase in applications when they move to the Common App.”</p>

  <p>The enrollment rate has also been continuously dropping. It decreased 2.4 percentage points from 26.2 percent in Fall 2020 to 23.8 percent this cycle for new freshmen. Overall, the percentage of all undergraduates students who were accepted as well as those who enrolled both dropped.</p>

  <p>Gundy attributed the drop in acceptance due to the sharp increase in applications.</p>

  <p>“We admitted fewer students very deliberately so that we could meet our enrollment targets,” Gundy told the Diamondback. “The more students that are exposed to Maryland, the better opportunity they have to consider the offerings that we have.”</p>

  <p>Gundy could not be reached for a comment for this story.</p>

  <p>The amount of minority students, which was brought into the spotlight after the racial justice protests in the summer of 2020, hasn’t changed since the previous application cycle. The percentage of Black students in the new freshman pool dropped by 1.1 percentage points, though the number of Black students increased. Just under 48 percent of all new freshmen enrolled for Fall 2021 semester were minority students.</p>

  <p>Mario Morias, a black Freshman student said considering the university's admittance rate UMD was doing fairly well in bringing in students of color.</p>

  <p>"If we look at other universities with low acceptance rates their diversity numbers aren’t that great," said Morias.</p>

  <p>He emphasized that UMD still needs to make progress on bringing more students into their STEM majors.</p>

  <p>"The makeup of most, if not all, STEM majors are pretty homogenous: straight, white, men," said the information science major. "It can be pretty uncomfortable sometimes because you feel like a representative for your identities when you’re the only one in the room."</p>

  <p>Asian-American students saw the largest increase in freshman enrollment, followed by Hispanic American students. The number of American Indian or Alaskan Natives freshmen as well as Native Hawaiian or other Pacific Islanders more than doubled. In 2020 there was only one student belonging to each ethnic category, but the former increased to 10 students and the later increased to three.</p>

  <p>The number of international students has also been steadily increasing, jumping to just over 30 percent this cycle.</p>

  <p>The university has not made any comment on the report or the effect that these trends will have on its proceedings.</p>

  <p>“What prospective students, and current students, should look for is that if UMD’s acceptance rate keeps trending this way, will the diversity score of the university change as well,” said Morias.</p>
