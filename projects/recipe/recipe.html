    <h1>Raspberry Buttermilk Cake Recipe</h1>
    <h2>About</h2>
        <p>Easy to make raspberry buttermilk cake. It makes for a quick and tender dessert with a hint of tangy flavor due to the buttermilk and sweet top crunch thanks to the Turbinado sugar. The raspberries are soft with an intense flavor to them. Combined with the vanilla-infused cake batter, you have a delicious, light cake. I enjoy topping the square with Chantilly but serving it alone is perfect too.
        It goes great alongside a cup of tea or coffee, or at the end of a wonderful summer dinner. This Raspberry Buttermilk Cake will soon become your favorite dessert.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 ½ cups flour</li>
        <li>¾ teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1 ½ teaspoon baking powder</li>
        <li>¾ cup unsalted butter, melted</li>
        <li>1 ½ cups granulated sugar</li>
        <li>2 large eggs</li>
        <li>1 egg yolk</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons vanilla extract</li>
        <li>⅔ cup buttermilk</li>
        <li>1 ½ cups raspberry</li>
        <li>Turbinado Sugar</li>
        <li>Chantilly</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Preparation</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 350F.</li>
        <li>Grease an 8x8 inch square pan with cooking spray or softened butter. Line the pan with parchment paper, allowing the paper to extend over the edges of the pan.</li>
        <li>In a small bowl whisk together the flour, baking powder, and salt. In a large bowl of a stand-alone KitchenAid, whisk together the melted butter and sugar. Once well-incorporated whisk in the eggs one at a time and the egg yolk, then vanilla extract, and buttermilk.</li>
        <li>Using a spatula gently fold the dry ingredients into the egg butter batter until all the flour is well mixed in. Transfer the batter to the prepared pan. Add the raspberries evenly over the top and generously sprinkle the cake with Turbinado sugar.</li>
        <li>Bake for 45 to 50 minutes or until a toothpick inserted in the middle comes out clean. If using a regular oven, turn the cake halfway through.</li>
        <li>Let the cake cool in the pan over a wire rack for 10 minutes. Use the parchment paper to lift the cake out. Let it cool completely. Serve it with dollops of whipped cream.</li>
    </ol>
